# Copper Concentrator Plant Process Analysis
Dr. Ortiz J.

This repository contains a Python programming solution for a simplified copper concentrator plant process. The goal is to determine the percentage of copper in the material at different stages of the process, including the entrance of the plant and the SAG mill.

## Requirements

- Python 3.0 or higher
- Pandas library
- NumPy library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Place the input CSV files `composicion.csv` and `sensores.csv` in the same directory as the source code.
3. Run the Python program `copper_concentrator.py` from the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE).
4. The program will read in the input CSV files and calculate the percentage of copper at different stages of the process.
5. The resulting data will be displayed in the console or can be exported to a CSV file.
